## Design

### Design Choices
The website was designed to make it look modern, simplistic, easy to use and accessible.

### Colour
I wanted to keep the color scheme simple and modern, with a touch of yellow as I feel this would make the webisite more appealing to the eye

### Fonts
The font I choice to use was "Kanit", with sans serif as the backup font. I feel this font gave off the modern vibe I was looking for

### Structure
To keep the website experience simple and easy to navigate I decided to go with navigation bar that displays the set menus: 
- Home page: Shows images of the facilities and advertises memberships
- Memberships page: Gives details about the memberships that are on offer with a link to the sign up page
- Sign up page: Allows the user to fill out a form with the preferred membership type
