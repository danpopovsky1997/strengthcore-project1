### Colour
I wanted to keep the color scheme simple and modern, with a touch of yellow as I feel this would make the website more appealing to the eye.

![Colours image](docs/colour-palette.PNG)

### Fonts
The font I decided to use was "Kanit", with sans serif as the backup font. I feel this font gave off a modern vibe that I was looking for.

### Structure
To keep the website experience simple and easy to navigate I decided to go with a navigation bar that displays the set menus: 
- Home page: Shows images of the facilities and advertises memberships
- Memberships page: Gives details about the memberships that are on offer with a link to the sign up page
- Sign up page: Allows the user to fill out a form with the preferred membership type

## Validation

### HTML Validation
To validate my HTML I used The Nu HTML Checker (W3C). This tool ensures any errors, warnings or mistakes are detected before release. I ran this on all of my pages and only a few issues were found in terms of headings and IDs. None that had any impacts on the overall result of the web page, although for future reference, I will take any issues found into consideration to ensure no errors are found.

</details>

<details><summary>Sign Up Page Validation</Summary>
<img src="docs/html-signup-check.PNG">  
</details>

### CSS Validation
To validate my CSS I used The W3C Jigsaw CSS Validation Service. This ensures any warnings or errors are found. I ran the validation service for my web page and it passed without any errors.
